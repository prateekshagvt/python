Image to Pencil Sketch Conversion
Introduction: This project involves converting a colored image into a pencil sketch using Python and the OpenCV library. The process includes several image processing techniques to achieve the desired effect.

Steps Involved:
1.Input: Load the image using OpenCV.
2.Grayscale Conversion: Simplify the image by converting it to grayscale.
3.Image Inversion: Invert the grayscale image to highlight the edges.
4.Blurring: Apply Gaussian blur to the inverted image to smooth it.
5.Blending: Combine the grayscale image with the blurred, inverted image to create the sketch effect.
6.Output: Save and display the final pencil sketch.

Real-Time Application:
Photo Editing: This technique can be used in photo editing applications to provide artistic effects.
Graphic Design: Designers can use pencil sketches as a base for creating detailed drawings.
Educational Tools: This project can be used as an educational tool to teach image processing concepts.

Conclusion: This project demonstrates how basic image processing techniques can be combined to achieve complex visual effects. By converting an image to a pencil sketch, we not only create a visually appealing effect but also learn about grayscale conversion, image inversion, blurring, and image blending techniques.
